Story:
	- overx for rreps strong in 100K
	- but why orates for rreps weak in 100K then?
	- all vs ureps
	- look at actual volumes in all buckets @1

Visualize:
	- in Mathematica, with a 3D plot
	- all day * bucket * value tables

Reorganize:
	- edit dir-*.tex files to achieve the correct order
	- in command.sh, it's not then enough to cat tex/line* > tex/dir-tag.tex; predefined order list?
	- get rid of creps or push them back?
	- select only those starbucks of interest or representative
	- see which tables are trivial, e.g. all 0s, and remove them while noting as such
Log buckets:
	- save_caps, both 1e-35 and -l 7 -c 1e-7
	- dolblens
	- normalize?
Fractional volume:
	- run vols fractions
	- add to command
Stov-nums:
	- aggregate 84 lines into a single table, say with 2 columns
Skews:
	- sort by skew within each day, estabish drank
	- compute dranks by bucket
	- or compute Kendall's Ï„
Pagerank:
	- compute with Jung for all days
	- stick into sqlite from Clojure
	- read with mfp's typed sqlite bindings into ocaml
Bucket Staying:
	- stay over in each bucket for more than N days, say (35-7)/2 or 7 @done
	- new bucket sizes, per class @done
	- filter existing stay counts for two values above, create bucket sizes @done
Bucket Volumes:
	all buckets
	- by replying tweets @done
	- by mentioning tweets @done
	- by repliers @done
	- by mentioners @done
	- rewrite to use full denums and produce both rvols,mvols at once @done
	- volumes as fractions @done
Bucket Ratios:
	all buckets
	- staying power within each buckets array @done
	interbuckets -- select bucket pairs
	- overlaps between types of graphs, for same ages @done
	- overlaps within same family, different weeks @done
Bucket B2B:
	all buckets
	- bucket to bucket by replies @done
	- bucket to bucket by mentions, for all buckets @done
	- condensing into a single table -- how? @done
Bucket Starrank:
	all buckets
	- starrank by replies @done
	- starrank by mentions @done
	- for two values of maturity @done
Write table formatters:
	- volumes: all 4? 2? 1? @done
	- staying rates in overlaps: in a matrix @done
	- starrank, my rank, audience rank: all 3? @done
	- b2b @done
Print with working tools:
	output include hierarchy paths, with a root at /t
	rates need assembilng into matrices!
	- staying rates @done
	- overlap rates, pairwise and staying for intersect @done
	
	- vols4 @done
	- b2br, b2bm @done
	- starbucks 1e-35, 1e-7, r & m @done
SF improvements:
	- 0.0 prob means no Random call
	- FOFNumFriends, FOFSocCap strategies
	- print edge counts in each cycle
